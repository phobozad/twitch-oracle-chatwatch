# twitch-oracle-chatwatch

## Overview
This app will login to a specific Twitch.tv channel and watch for users entering the `!play` command in chat.

Each user that enters this command will be added to an Oracle Database that can be used to create player records and provide auto-completion of Twitch usernames.

Data will be batched up and pushed into the database on a configurable interval (default: 5 seconds).  If there is more than one player that entered `!play` during the interval, the data will be inserted as a single row with multiple comma-separated usernames.

## Installation
### Windows
**Download & double-click to run the pre-compiled version that comes with NodeJS bundled in or run from source using below steps:**

1.	Install NodeJS 14+ from https://nodejs.org/en/ (LTS release reccomended).
	* The "Tools for Native Modules" isn't required to use this app, so this can be left unchecked during installation.
2.	Download the app using a git pull or by downloading a ZIP file of the repo from github and extracting to a folder.
3.	Run the "Node.js command prompt" shortcut that is now in the start menu
	* This just runs `C:\Program Files\nodejs\nodevars.bat` assuming default install location was selected for NodeJS
4.	Navigate in the command prompt to the folder that holds this app
	```
	cd "c:\users\username\downloads\twitch-oracle-chatwatch"
	```
5.	Install the required NodeJS modules (This must be run inside the app's folder)
	```
	npm install
	```
6.	Install Visual Studio 2017 Redistributable if not already installed (required for Oracle Instant Client)
	https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
7.	Download the Oracle Instant Client (Basic Lite version) and extract into the `oracle_instant` folder
	* Extract everything from the sub-folder in the ZIP into the `oracle_instant` folder - do not keep the folder name used in the ZIP (that includes version number)
	https://download.oracle.com/otn_software/nt/instantclient/instantclient-basiclite-windows.zip
	https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/winx64-64-downloads.html
8.	Copy the `settings.ini.example` file to `settings.ini`
8.	Edit the `settings.ini` file and fill in the required info (username, password, API key, table name, etc.)
9.	Start the App (bot.js) using NodeJS
	```
	node bot.js
	```

For subsequent launches, just run the `node bot.js` command to start the app from within the Node.js command prompt.  To simplify this, you could create a batch file that can just be double-clicked to launch.

#### Example startbot.bat (adjust paths to match your environment):
```
cd "c:\users\username\downloads\twitch-oracle-chatwatch"
"C:\Program Files\nodejs\nodevars.bat"
node bot.js
```
