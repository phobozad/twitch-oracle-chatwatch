;  Twitch Chat Settings
; 
; "channel" is the twitch channel the bot will join to listen for messages
; 
; Should use a dedicated bot account for this to lower risk in case of credentials/API keys become compromised.
; 
; For password, need to use oauth and not real password.
; For really quick & dirty setup go to https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ while logged in with the bot twitch account.
; After authorizing, you will end up with a string that looks like "oauth:34adf8adf3adf81341234" - use this for the password setting including the "oauth:" part

[twitch]
username = marblesbot
password = oauth:42adf3k1341klkmkm134
channel = nightattack


; AirTable Settings

; 
; Go to https://airtable.com/account to generate an API key.
; This provides access to update the airtables in your account.
; Enter this for "apiKey"

; 
; Every AirTable has a Base ID to uniquely identify it
; To get this ID, go to https://airtable.com/api and click on the base you want to use.
; On the "Introduction" tab (first tab that shows up), you will see "The ID of this base is" followed by the ID in green text.
; Enter this for "baseID"

; "tableName" - AirTable Table to insert records into
; "fieldName" - This field in the above table will be populated with the player's twitch Display Name (username)
; "updateIntervalMs" - How often (in milliseconds) the player list is batched up and pushed into AirTables (e.g. 5000 = 5 seconds). For API rate-limiting.

[airtable]
apiKey = keyDKkn3md78aQ
baseID = applk132m1nd7ak
tableName = ViewersAutoComplete
fieldName = PlayerName
updateIntervalMs = 5000

[marbles]
; "playEmotes" - these are emotes that work just like !play to join a race.  These change over time, so this should be kept up-to-date
; some regular marbles players use these to join games even on other channels rather than using !play, so we need to catch them as well
